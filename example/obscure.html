  <h2>--- Quest 1 - B: Sum stuff and more ---</h2>

  <p>
    You want to sum things, but you don't know how to do it. You have a list of
    numbers, and you want to sum them all. Can you do it?
  </p>

  <p>A bit of context to put some context and story to the quest.</p>

  <p>Example:</p>

  <code>
    45 <br />
    15 <br />
    20
  </code>

  <p>We sum (45 * 2) + (15 * 2) + (20 * 2)</p>
  <p>Will give the result: 160</p>
